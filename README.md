# DiscreteScrollView
The library is a RecyclerView-based implementation of a scrollable list, where current item is centered and can be changed using swipes.
It is similar to a ViewPager, but you can quickly and painlessly create layout, where views adjacent to the currently selected view are partially or fully visible on the screen. 

A scrollable list of items that centers the current element and provides easy-to-use APIs for cool item animations.
