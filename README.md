# DiscreteScrollView
The library is a RecyclerView-based implementation of a scrollable list, where current item is centered and can be changed using swipes.
It is similar to a ViewPager, but you can quickly and painlessly create layout, where views adjacent to the currently selected view are partially or fully visible on the screen. 

A scrollable list of items that centers the current element and provides easy-to-use APIs for cool item animations.

## Usage

### Step 1

#### In older Gradle Style (Build.gradle (project level))
```
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url "https://maven.google.com" }
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    maven { url "https://repo.grails.org/grails/core/" }
  }
}
```

#### In New Project Structure (Settings.gradle)
```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        ......
        maven { url "https://maven.google.com" }
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        maven { url "https://repo.grails.org/grails/core/" }
        .....
    }
}
```

### Step 2

Include the library as a local library project or add the dependency in your build.gradle.

# For groovy DSL

```
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.github.SultanAyubi360:DiscreteScrollView_Library:1.0'
}
```

# For Kotlin DSL


```
dependencies {
    implementation ("com.github.SultanAyubi360:DiscreteScrollView_Library:1.0")
}
```
